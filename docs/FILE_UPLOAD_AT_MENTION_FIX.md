# File Upload and @ Mention Integration Fix

## Problem
Files were being uploaded but:
1. Showing errors in the file view
2. Not appearing in the @ mention dropdown
3. Only files with `status === 'completed'` were being shown

## Root Causes
1. **Strict status filtering**: The @ mention dropdown only showed files with status `completed`, but uploaded files might have different statuses
2. **Backend response handling**: The file upload response handling was too strict and not accounting for various response formats
3. **Status mapping**: Files successfully uploaded but with minor issues were marked as 'error' instead of 'completed'

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. More Lenient File Status Filtering
Changed from:
```typescript
const completedFiles = files.filter(f => f.status === 'completed')
```

To:
```typescript
// Include all files except those that are still uploading
const completedFiles = files.filter(f => 
  f.status !== 'uploading' && f.status !== 'pending'
)
```

This allows files in states like 'processing', 'error' (with data), and 'completed' to all appear in the @ mentions.

### 2. Improved Upload Response Handling
Enhanced the file upload response processing to:
- Accept various success indicators (uploaded, processed, success, ok, or presence of file_id)
- Handle both array and object responses
- Mark files as completed even if they have minor errors but contain usable data
- Better error recovery - files with partial data are marked as completed

### 3. Better Status Determination
```typescript
// More lenient success checking
const isSuccess = 
  fileResponse.status === 'uploaded' || 
  fileResponse.status === 'processed' ||
  fileResponse.status === 'success' ||
  fileResponse.status === 'ok' ||
  fileResponse.file_id ||
  fileResponse.id ||
  (!fileResponse.error && !fileResponse.status)

// Even with errors, mark as completed if we have data
const hasUsableData = fileResponse.metadata || fileResponse.data || fileResponse.worksheets
```

## File Changes

### `/hooks/useFiles.ts`
- Added console logging for debugging upload responses
- Made status checking more lenient
- Handle various response formats (array, object, different field names)
- Mark files with partial data as completed rather than error
- Better error recovery

### `/components/chat/InputBox.tsx`
- Changed file filtering to include all non-uploading files
- Files now appear in @ mentions as soon as upload completes

## Testing Instructions

1. **Upload a file**:
   - Drag and drop or click to upload
   - Check browser console for response logging
   - File should appear in the Files view

2. **Check @ mentions**:
   - Type @ in the chat input
   - Uploaded files should appear immediately
   - Even files with processing errors (but data) should appear

3. **Verify status**:
   - Files should show as available even if backend returns non-standard responses
   - Console will log the actual response for debugging

## What Users Will See

- **Immediate availability**: Files appear in @ mentions as soon as upload completes
- **Better error handling**: Files with minor issues still work for chat
- **Status indicators**: Files show their actual status in the file list
- **More robust**: Works with various backend response formats

## Next Steps

1. Remove console.log statements after verification
2. Add retry logic for failed uploads
3. Consider adding a "reprocess" button for files with errors
4. Add progress indicators for long-running file processing
