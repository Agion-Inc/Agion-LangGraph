## Key Findings

### 1. Production Readiness

**LangGraph:** ✅ Production-Proven
- Uber, LinkedIn, Elastic, Replit in production
- 400+ companies deployed since beta
- LangGraph Platform GA (2025)
- Enterprise SLA available

**AutoGen:** ⚠️ Research-Focused
> "AutoGen is primarily a developer tool to enable rapid prototyping and research. It is not a production ready tool." — Microsoft Docs

- Community support only
- Few production case studies
- Still maturing (v0.4 breaking changes)

**Custom:** ✅ Production-Ready (If Built Right)
- Full control over stability
- But requires 8 weeks + ongoing maintenance

**Winner:** 🏆 LangGraph (battle-tested)

---

### 2. Multi-Agent Architecture

**LangGraph:** ✅ Graph-Based (Best)
```
[Router] → Conditional Edges → [Agent 1]
                              → [Agent 2]
                              → [Agent 3]
```
- Visual representation
- Deterministic flow
- Easy debugging
- Predictable behavior

**AutoGen:** ⚠️ Conversation-Based
```
Agent 1 talks to Agent 2 talks to Agent 3 ...
```
- Emergent behavior (harder to predict)
- Complex to debug
- Less deterministic

**Custom:** Build It Yourself
- Can design any pattern
- But starts from scratch

**Winner:** 🏆 LangGraph (graph > conversation)

---

### 3. Developer Experience

**LangGraph:**
```python
# 50 lines for full multi-agent system
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_supervisor

supervisor = create_supervisor(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet",
    agents=[("chart", "Creates charts"), ("anomaly", "Detects anomalies")]
)
```

**AutoGen:**
```python
# 200+ lines for similar functionality
from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
from autogen_agentchat.teams import RoundRobinGroupChat

chart_agent = AssistantAgent(name="chart", ...)
anomaly_agent = AssistantAgent(name="anomaly", ...)
team = RoundRobinGroupChat([chart_agent, anomaly_agent])
```

**Custom:**
```python
# 600+ lines to build framework first
# Then 100+ lines per agent
```

## Questions?

1. **Q:** Why not AutoGen if Microsoft backs it?
   **A:** Microsoft says it's for research/prototyping, not production. LangGraph has 400+ production deployments.

2. **Q:** Why not custom if we have full control?
   **A:** Takes 4x longer ($35K-$70K more), reinvents solved problems, ongoing maintenance burden.

3. **Q:** What if LangGraph doesn't work out?
   **A:** Graph structure is portable, agent logic is standard Python. Migration path exists.

4. **Q:** Do we need LangGraph Platform?
   **A:** No, optional. Can self-host. Platform adds managed deployment, scaling, monitoring.

5. **Q:** How hard is the learning curve?
   **A:** 1-2 days. Excellent docs, many examples. Graph concepts are intuitive.
