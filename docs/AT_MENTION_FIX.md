# @ Mention Feature Fix Documentation

## Problem
The @ mention dropdown menu was not appearing when typing "@" in the chat input box.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Cursor position detection**: The original implementation only checked for @ mentions when the message changed, but wasn't properly tracking cursor position changes
2. **Event handling**: The detection wasn't triggered on all necessary events (keyup, mouse clicks for cursor movement)
3. **Dropdown visibility condition**: The dropdown was only showing when items existed, not showing the helpful "no items" state

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Event Detection
```typescript
// Added multiple event handlers to detect @ mentions
onChange={(e) => {
  setMessage(e.target.value)
  setTimeout(() => checkForAtMention(), 0) // Check after DOM update
}}
onKeyUp={() => checkForAtMention()}      // Detect cursor movement with arrows
onMouseUp={() => checkForAtMention()}    // Detect cursor placement via click
```

### 2. Improved @ Detection Logic
- Made `checkForAtMention` a `useCallback` hook for better performance
- Added proper dependency tracking
- Added console logging for debugging
- Handle empty query case (`@` with no text after)

### 3. Always Show Dropdown
Changed from:
```typescript
{showAutocomplete && displayItems.length > 0 && (
```
To:
```typescript
{showAutocomplete && (
```
This ensures the dropdown appears even when no items match, showing helpful messages.

### 4. Better Empty States
Added informative messages when:
- No files or agents are available at all
- No items match the current filter
- Searching for specific types (files vs agents)

## Features of the @ Mention System

### How It Works
1. **Type @** anywhere in the message to trigger the dropdown
2. **Continue typing** after @ to filter items (e.g., `@data` filters to items containing "data")
3. **Navigate** with:
   - ↑↓ arrow keys to move through items
   - Tab between All/Files/Agents sections
   - Enter or Tab to select
   - Escape to dismiss

### Visual Design
- **Files**: Blue theme with document icon, prefixed with `file:`
- **Agents**: Purple theme with CPU chip icon, prefixed with `agent:`
- **Tabs**: Switch between viewing All items, only Files, or only Agents
- **Item counts**: Shows number of files and agents in tab headers
- **Selection highlight**: Currently selected item has colored background
- **Keyboard hints**: Shows available keyboard shortcuts at bottom

### Integration
- Selected files are tracked and sent with the message
- Selected agent routes the message to that specific agent
- Without agent selection, uses intelligent routing (orchestrator)

## Testing the Feature

### In Development
1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Open the browser console to see debug logs
3. Navigate to the chat interface
4. Type "@" in the input field
5. You should see:
   - Console log showing detection details
   - Dropdown appearing (even if empty)
   - Helpful message if no files/agents loaded

### Debug Information
The console will log:
```javascript
{
  cursorPosition: 1,        // Where cursor is
  textBeforeCursor: "@",    // Text before cursor
  atMatch: ["@", ""],       // Regex match result
  message: "@",             // Full message
  completedFiles: 0,        // Number of available files
  agents: 0                 // Number of available agents
}
```

### Troubleshooting
If the dropdown still doesn't appear:
1. **Check Console**: Look for the debug logs - are they firing?
2. **Check Data**: Are files/agents being loaded? The dropdown shows even without data
3. **Check Network**: Make sure the API endpoints for agents/files are responding
4. **Force Refresh**: Clear cache and hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

## File Changes Made
1. **InputBox.tsx**:
   - Added `useCallback` import
   - Enhanced event handlers on textarea
   - Improved @ detection logic
   - Fixed dropdown visibility condition
   - Added better empty states

2. **FilesChatInput.tsx**:
   - Updated to handle agent parameter
   - Support for specific agent routing

3. **ChatContainer.tsx**:
   - Updated message handler signature
   - Added agent routing logic

## Next Steps
1. Remove console.log statements after confirming it works
2. Consider adding mock data for development/testing
3. Add unit tests for @ mention detection
4. Consider persisting recently used agents/files for quick access
