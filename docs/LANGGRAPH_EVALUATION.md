## What is LangGraph?

LangGraph is a **low-level orchestration framework** for building stateful, multi-agent AI systems using **directed graphs**. Think of it as a state machine where:

- **Nodes** = Agents or functions
- **Edges** = Control flow and routing
- **State** = Shared memory across agents

```python
# Simple LangGraph agent
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
workflow.add_node("router", route_query)
workflow.add_node("chart_agent", chart_generator)
workflow.add_node("anomaly_agent", anomaly_detector)

# Define flow
workflow.set_entry_point("router")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("router", should_continue, {
    "chart": "chart_agent",
    "anomaly": "anomaly_agent",
    "end": END
})

app = workflow.compile()
```

**Key Innovation**: Represents workflows as **graphs** not conversations, giving you:
- Visual representation of agent flow
- Deterministic execution paths
- Easy debugging (graph visualization)
- Predictable behavior

## Deep Dive: Why LangGraph is Perfect for Agent-Chat

### 1. **Production Proven** ✅

Unlike AutoGen (research/prototype), LangGraph is **battle-tested in production**:

| Company | Use Case | Result |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Uber** | Large-scale code migrations | Streamlined developer platform |
| **LinkedIn** | SQL Bot (NL → SQL) | Internal tool for data access |
| **Elastic** | Real-time threat detection | Faster security response |
| **Replit** | AI coding assistant | Production deployment |
| **AppFolio** | Realm-X property manager copilot | 10+ hours saved/week |

**400+ companies** deployed LangGraph agents to production since beta.

### 2. **Multi-Agent Patterns Built-In** ✅

LangGraph provides exactly what you need:

#### **Supervisor Pattern** (What Agent-Chat needs)
```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_supervisor

# Define specialized agents
agents = [
    ("chart_generator", "Creates charts from data"),
    ("anomaly_detector", "Detects data anomalies"),
    ("general_assistant", "Answers general questions")
]

# Supervisor automatically routes
supervisor = create_supervisor(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet",
    agents=agents
)
```

#### **Swarm Pattern** (Future enhancement)
```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_swarm

# Agents hand off to each other
swarm = create_swarm(
    agents=[chart_agent, sql_agent, report_agent],
    handoff_rules={"chart_done": "sql_agent"}
)
```

### 3. **State Management** ✅

```python
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: List[Message]
    uploaded_files: List[str]
    selected_agent: str
    chart_data: Optional[Dict]
    conversation_history: List[Dict]

# State automatically persists across agent calls
# Built-in checkpointing for resumable workflows
```

### 4. **Streaming Support** ✅

```python
# Real-time streaming to frontend
async for chunk in app.stream(user_query):
    # Send token-by-token or step-by-step
    yield chunk
```

### 5. **Human-in-the-Loop** ✅

```python
# Pause for approval
workflow.add_node("require_approval", check_with_human)
workflow.add_conditional_edges("require_approval", {
    "approved": "continue",
    "rejected": "restart"
})
```

### 6. **Observability with LangSmith** ✅

- Trace every agent call
- Debug failures visually
- Monitor performance
- Audit compliance

# 2. Create Agents
chart_agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet",
    tools=[load_excel, create_chart],
    name="chart_generator"
)

anomaly_agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet",
    tools=[load_data, detect_anomalies],
    name="anomaly_detector"
)

# 3. Build Graph
workflow = StateGraph(ChatState)

# Add nodes
workflow.add_node("router", route_to_agent)
workflow.add_node("chart", chart_agent)
workflow.add_node("anomaly", anomaly_agent)
workflow.add_node("general", general_agent)

# Define routing
def route_to_agent(state):
    query = state["messages"][-1]["content"]
    if "chart" in query.lower():
        return "chart"
    elif "anomaly" in query.lower():
        return "anomaly"
    else:
        return "general"

workflow.set_entry_point("router")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("router", route_to_agent, {
    "chart": "chart",
    "anomaly": "anomaly",
    "general": "general"
})

# All agents return to END
workflow.add_edge("chart", END)
workflow.add_edge("anomaly", END)
workflow.add_edge("general", END)

# 4. Compile
app = workflow.compile()

# 5. Use
async for event in app.stream({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": query}]}):
    print(event)
```

**That's it!** ~50 lines for full multi-agent system.

## Code Examples: Common Patterns

### 1. Simple Agent
```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

agent = create_react_agent(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet",
    tools=[tool1, tool2],
    state_modifier="You are a helpful assistant"
)

result = agent.invoke({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]})
```

### 2. Multi-Agent Supervisor
```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_supervisor

supervisor = create_supervisor(
    model="anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet",
    agents=[
        ("agent1", "Description of agent 1"),
        ("agent2", "Description of agent 2"),
    ]
)

result = supervisor.invoke({"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": query}]})
```

### 3. Custom Graph
```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END

workflow = StateGraph(MyState)
workflow.add_node("step1", function1)
workflow.add_node("step2", function2)
workflow.add_edge("step1", "step2")
workflow.add_edge("step2", END)

app = workflow.compile()
result = app.invoke({"input": "data"})
```

### 4. Streaming
```python
async for event in app.stream(input_data):
    print(event)  # Real-time updates
```

### 5. State Persistence
```python
from langgraph.checkpoint import MemorySaver

memory = MemorySaver()
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)

# Conversation state automatically saved and resumed
```
